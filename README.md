**_An app that moves with you_**

**BuddyBeat** is an Android mobile player application that adjusts the music playback speed in real time according to your walking or running pace, while also dynamically reordering your playlist to best match your workout rhythm.

## Motivation and Concept
It all started with a question: **How can we make workouts more engaging and enjoyable?** For many of us, music is an essential part of our workouts, providing the motivation needed to get through challenging runs or to simply enjoy a walk. 
However, finding the right music in the moment of activity can be tough, and having inadequate song interrupt the flow can be frustrating. So we wanted to address this problem faced by fitness enthusiasts: **staying in the rhythm during a workout**.  
The idea behind BuddyBeat was to create a simple, intuitive, and engaging app that is easy to use and feels like a natural extension of a workout routine.

## Project Description
The app is structured similarly to a standard music player, allowing the user to play, skip and pause songs, add them to favorites, create and manage playlists etc. However, BuddyBeat offers two new features: 
- **Real-time Speed Adjustment**: Adjust the speed of the current song to match your activity, using your phone's accelerometer to detect your pa+ce.
- **Dynamic Playlist Reordering**: Dynamically update the playlist queue to ensure future songs align with your workout rhythm, making transitions smoother and workouts more engaging.

With BuddyBeat, workouts become more immersive, as the music responds to your pace, helping you maintain a consistent rhythm and enjoy a more enjoyable fitness routine.
